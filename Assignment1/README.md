# Assignment 1

In the first part of the assignment, we aim to **colour quantize** the image using various techniques: **Popularity Algorithm**, **Median Cut Algorithm** and **Floyd & Steinberg Algorithm**. In the second part, we aim to transfer colour to a target grayscale image from a source (coloured) image using **Global Image Matching** and **Swatch Transfer Algorithm**.
