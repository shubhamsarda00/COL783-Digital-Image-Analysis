# Assignment 1

In the first part of the assignment, we aim to **colour quantize** the image using various techniques: **Popularity Algorithm**, **Median Cut Algorithm** and **Floyd & Steinberg Algorithm**, described in **p297-heckbert.pdf** (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/965145.801294). In the second part, we aim to transfer colour to a target grayscale image from a coloured source image using **Global Image Matching** and **Swatch Transfer Algorithm**, described in **colorize.pdf** (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/566654.566576).
